      Helpful Hints for Motorhome & Campervan Owners Battery Care Leisure
      batteries are essential for your motorhome or campervanâ€™s power
      management. Keep them fully charged whenever possible. During winter,
      connect to 230V power once a week, as limited daylight may impact solar
      charging. Winter Drainage Drain water from your motorhome or campervan
      after each winter trip. Frozen water can expand and damage pipes or
      boilers. Fridge Preparation Turn on your fridge 24 hours before departure
      and load with cold items to maintain temperature.
